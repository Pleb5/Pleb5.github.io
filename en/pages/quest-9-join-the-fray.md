## Most importantly
{: .no_toc }

FOSS wins if we stand together and build a future where everyone can be free and sovereign if they are willing to take responsibility and demonstrate Proof of Work.

The world of freedom and prosperity we dream about can only come true if we all do our parts and spread the word about bitcoin and FOSS. You are a part of this now. You know the Truth.

Donate to worthy FOSS projects and contribute to FOSS however you can.

## Acknowledgments
This program could not have come to life without the selfless help and guidance of fellow bitcoiners. Communities around open-source projects mentioned in this program have been vital to wrapping my head around bitcoin topics. Most notably the Sparrow, SeedSigner and Raspiblitz communities have been, and continue to be reliable sources of truth when learning about sovereign bitcoin usage. The maintainers, collaborators and support-volunteers of these projects are the cornerstones in the Citadels of so many Plebs.

Special thanks to Matt Odell for sending 100% signal through the Citadel Dispatch podcast. Must-listen-to for any Pleb. Don't forget to send some love by streaming some sats.

Also big thanks goes to Yegor Petrov for providing me with the cool graphics used throughout this website:
