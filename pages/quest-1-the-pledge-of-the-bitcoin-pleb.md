# Quest 1: Pledge of the Bitcoin Pleb


You decide to go down the rabbit hole of Bitcoin Self-Custody. You want the freedom and sovereignty that comes with it instead of the fractional-reserve IOU that people mistake for money. Or you just heard of the previous crypto exchange debacle and don’t want to lose your hard-earned bitcoin. Whatever the case, you want to be in control.

Before you actually start your journey, you have to be crystal clear about your motivations and commit yourself to the Process. Bitcoin Self-Custody is hard, whatever others told you. Becoming a Bitcoin Pleb is about adopting responsibility and putting in the hard work. Not because it is impossible to comprehend the technology part. It is because most people don't actually want to be sovereign, they just talk about it.

This training program is for those who strive to be Bitcoin Pleb sovereign individuals. But this is not merely about becoming sovereign. It is also about becoming the “Uncle Jim” for your friends and loved ones in bitcoin custody issues. We cannot rely on companies and centralized fragile entities to share Self-Custody Wisdom that is required for a resilient decentralized bitcoin future. We need grassroots adoption. We need people who are willing to go far and beyond to do the work and share the knowledge. You need to train your computer skills and also soak up the Pleb Culture of bitcoin. Do you recognize yourself in this description? Are you ready to put in the work? This is for you then.
