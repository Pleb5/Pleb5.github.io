# Quest 1: Pledge of the Bitcoin Pleb


You decide to go down the rabbit hole of Bitcoin Self-Custody. You want the freedom and sovereignty that comes with it. Or you just heard of the previous crypto exchange debacle and don’t want to lose your hard-earned bitcoin. Whatever the case, you want to be in control.

Before you actually start your journey, you have to be crystal clear about your motivations and commit yourself to the Process. Bitcoin Self-Custody is hard, whatever others told you. Becoming a Bitcoin Pleb is about adopting responsibility and putting in the hard work.

This training program is for those who strive to be Bitcoin Pleb sovereign individuals. But this is not merely about becoming sovereign. It is also about becoming the “Uncle Jim” for your friends and loved ones in bitcoin custody issues. We cannot rely on companies and centralized fragile entities to share Self-Custody Wisdom that is required for a resilient decentralized bitcoin future. We need grassroots adoption. We need people who are willing to go far and beyond to do the work and share the knowledge. You need to train your computer skills and also soak up the Pleb Culture of bitcoin. Do you recognize yourself in this description? Are you ready to put in the work? This is for you then.

## OBJECTIVE: Complete the [Pledge of the Bitcoin Pleb] assignment(hybrid pdf download)
* It will make you think about whether this is really for you
* It is not a hand-in assignment
* You can edit the hybrid pdf in libreoffice if you like
* Changed your mind? No problem at all. Come back later when you feel like you're truly ready for it

**Congratulations if you finished it!**
In my estimation you are in that 10-20% cohort of people who cared to complete this exercise. If you really put effort in it you now have a 10-20X more chance to become a Bitcoin Pleb.

Anyone is only responsible for themselves in Bitcoin. Therefore, individual work is a must. But you will not be alone on your path to sovereignty. The Bitcoin Plebs Community is there for us to help each other out, share experiences and discuss ideas.

Advice: Take some time between objectives to reflect. Take notes and absorb what just happened. Search for more content about it. Try to contest what I tell you, even. The more you play with it, the deeper your knowledge will penetrate. This is not a sprint, it is a marathon. A journey.
