**Important Note**: You are going to use Bitcoin Testnet(specifically the latest and most stable one called ‚Äúsignet‚Äù) to simulate a life-like environment where you can safely hone your Pleb skills and experiment!

Feel free to not just complete the exercises but also try out other exciting things! You can‚Äôt really screw anything up once you‚Äôve made sure you‚Äôre using testnet which will be obvious to check.

**Rumors have it your exchange will file for bankruptcy soon! üí±üí∏**

**You really need to take ownership of your coins or they will be frozen for eternity!**

## OBJECTIVE: Create your first Bitcoin wallet!([Progress Images](/progress-the-journey-begins/){:target="_blank"})

2. Create your first Bitcoin Wallet. `Go to File` --> `New Wallet`
3. Give it a name like ‚Äúmyfirstwallet‚Äù
4. Use the preset options: Single sig, Native Segwit
5. Select  ‚ÄúNew or Imported Software Wallet‚Äù
6. Select `Use 12 Words` from the dropdown menu
7. Click `Generate New`

9. Click `Confirm Backup` and `Re-enter Words`
10. Re-enter them from the paper backup
11. Click `Create Keystore`
12. Click `Import Keystore`. It takes you to the finalizing stage of the Wallet creation process
13. Hover over the little question mark icons to get a sense of what all these things are about. Look at the Master fingerprint tooltip message carefully
14. On the paper where you wrote down the words write your wallet name and master fingerprint as well to keep track of this wallet
    1. It is a unique wallet ID derived from the Xpub
15. Click `Apply`. Click `No Password`. Tabs on the left turned blue from gray
16. Go to the `Transactions tab`. See that this is indeed a completely empty wallet. Sparrow did not find any transactions associated with it

Your exchange is on the brink of collapse. The yield generator algorithms sadly did not work out well in the long run. Now you really have to leave the sinking ship!
