Anyone serious about Bitcoin and IT security recommends a Linux operating system. Laptops and Desktops have stronger computational capabilities so they are better suited for Bitcoin operations than mobile phones.

## OBJECTIVE: Gear up!
1. Get a decent new or used Laptop/PC that you dedicate to bitcoin. Main parameters:
    1. At least 4GB RAM
    2. 1TB SSD. Many laptops don‚Äôt have that much SSD capacity by default but it is easy to get an SSD-case with a USB connector
        1. SanDisk is a decent brand. Get the 2.5‚Äù size
        2. Ugreen is one option for the case. Look for UASP support and make sure the SSD fits in
    3. USB stick, at least 8GB to install Operating System
    4. Place the computer somewhere safe in your apartment and use a wired internet connection
2. **You can compromise by using a machine with less RAM and SSD because most quests are designed for bitcoin testnet, a simulated bitcoin environment.** However, once you want to change to mainnet for the real deal, you will need to meet the above requirements

## OBJECTIVE: Install a fresh Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS
1. üí° Learn about the [Linux terminal](/pleb-lessons/#the-linux-terminalaka-linux-command-line-shell-bash)
2. If you get stuck Ubuntu website has [a guide too](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview){:target="_blank"}(with images)
3. The commands in the guide are not always exact because program versions and file names can vary. Text in `<angle brackets>` mean you must replace that with your version. Use `tab completion` often to avoid having to type much and get the commands right
4. Download the [desktop image](https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/){:target="_blank"} on whatever operating system your machine is running right now
5. Download and install [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher#download-etcher){:target="_blank"}, a great software to burn images. Linux instructions:
    1. Download the Appimage for Linux x64 from the website
    2. AppImage files are portable programs. They can be run without installation
    3. Make the file executable
        ```sh
		chmod +x balenaEtcher<version>.AppImage
		```
    4. Run the software from command line in the Downloads directory
        ```sh
		./balenaEtcher<version>
		```
    5. If you haven‚Äôt dealt with AppImage files before it will most probably complain about missing libfuse. Just install it in this case
        ```sh
		sudo apt install fuse
		```
    6. Try to run it again
5. Burn the image on the USB drive
6. Reboot your computer from the USB stick and select the first option: `‚ÄúTry or install Ubuntu‚Äù`
7. Select `‚ÄúMinimal installation‚Äù`
8. Select `‚ÄúErase disk and install Ubuntu‚Äù`. Follow instructions
9. Name your user and choose a strong, dedicated password
10. Leave it on the default `‚ÄúRequire my password to login‚Äù`. Continue
11. Complete the process
12. Once it is done, go for these options for your privacy:
    7. Don‚Äôt connect social accounts
    8. Don‚Äôt send any usage info to canonical
    9. Switch OFF location services
13. Install updates when Ubuntu prompts you
14. Set up Firefox
    10. Make it the default browser
    11. Make DuckDuckGo your search engine, it is more private. In the settings search bar you can easily find this setting
15. Quick tip: To launch an application press the `‚ÄúSuper‚Äù` button(mostly with windows icon) and start typing the name
16. Quick tip: Add to favorites (left column) makes things convenient. by Super --> Type name --> Right-click --> Add to favorites
17. Don‚Äôt bloat this system too much with unnecessary apps because it is a risk. Try to keep it restricted to software you need for bitcoin

## OBJECTIVE: Join the Bitcoin Plebs community([Progress images](/progress-get-on-board/){:target="_blank"})
1. üí°Learn about the [nostr protocol](/pleb-lessons/#nostrnotes-and-other-stuff-transmitted-by-relays) that allows you to connect to the bitcoin plebs community
2. üí°Learn about the concept of [public key cryptography](/pleb-lessons/#public-key-cryptography)
2. Start taking notes on anything new and noteworthy: techniques, commands, configurations, resources etc.
    1. Open ‚Äúgedit‚Äù and create a text note file ‚Äúbitcoin plebs notes‚Äù
    2. **Don't use it for private keys or passwords!**
    3. **Don‚Äôt use Google keep or any other non-encrypted cloud-based note app for delicate information because you create a security and/or privacy risk! Keep very sensitive notes offline, encrypted and create backups from time to time. More tips on this later...**
3. Install the **[Alby extension](https://getalby.com/#alby-extension) in your browser**
4. Create a new Alby account. `Lightning address` too.
5. Backup your password:
    1. In a [Password manager](https://bitwarden.com){:target="_blank"} 
    2. You can even write it in a paper notebook
6. Pin the Alby extension in the browser
7. Navigate to `Discover` in Alby and find the `Nostr` section. You can do the same if you click on your account in the top-right corner and select `Account settings`
8. Generate a new nostr private key. It will automatically also generate your public key
8. **You must keep this key as safe as possible!** Therefore write it down in your Password manager and/or your paper notebook
8. Now all your nostr-related data is handled by Alby. Alby can handle all browser-based nostr client permissions wherever it is installed as an extension
8. Go to the **[Coracle](https://coracle.social/){:target="_blank"}** nostr client. It is a stable browser-based client with public chat room support
9. Log into Coracle automatically with Alby:
    1. Click `Login`
    3. Click `Login` again for a simple login process
    4. Confirm in Alby to allow Coracle to read your public key
    5. You can edit permissions and automatic actions in Alby for Coracle and other clients
10. In Coracle, go to the `Relay` section in the left menu then go to `Browse Relays` and setup to connect at least to these relays:
    ```sh
    wss://relay.btcplebs.com/nostrrelay/asdf1234
    ```
    ```sh
    wss://relay.damus.io
    ```
10. Go to the `Search` section in the left menu. Follow my account if you have any questions. Search the `nip05 identity` or my account public key(npub)
    ```sh
	five@btcplebs.com
	```
    ```sh
	npub16p8v7varqwjes5hak6q7mz6pygqm4pwc6gve4mrned3xs8tz42gq7kfhdw
	```
11. Go to the `Chat` section in the left menu and join the **BitcoinPlebs.org** group chat:
    1. Start typing the group name `bitoinplebs` and Coracle should find the group
    2. Click `Join`
    3. Now Coracle should show the group in the `Your Rooms` section
11. Send your first message in the group: ‚ÄúHello, fellow Bitcoin Plebs!‚Äù
11. You can install [Damus](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/damus/id1628663131){:target="_blank"}(iOS) or [Amethyst](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitorpamplona.amethyst){:target="_blank"}(Android) on your phone. They both have the group chat feature
12. Run a nostr client on your phone:
    1. Alby cannot handle phone apps so you will have to initialize these apps by putting your nostr private key in the smartphone
    1. **DON'T PASTE YOUR PRIVATE KEY IN CLOUD-BASED NOTE APPS AND DON'T SEND IT VIA EMAIL OR ANY OTHER UNENCRYPTED MEANS!**
    2. Type in character by character or send it to your device in an encrypted way, e.g. a [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download/){:target="_blank"} `Note to self` message. Signal can be installed on desktops and has a mobile app too
12. In different clients there can be different ways to find groups. Try to find public group chats in this order:
    1. Find it by group name: `BitcoinPlebs.org Group chat`
    2. Find it by group hex ID:
    ```sh
	    b69947cbebde46b739173ad1373fec9f5dc4e4e30cc2fe209a2a5011795e05a8
	  ```
    3. Or try the same group ID in different("bech32") form:
    ```sh
    note1k6v50jltmertwwgh8tgnw0lvnawufe8rpnp0ugy69fgpz727qk5qj74f57
    ```
19. If it went fine, shortly you can see the same profile info and messages you sent on your desktop.
20. Not all nostr clients have group chat functionality implemented. I can recommend some decent clients with Twitter-like feed and direct messaging functionality:
    1. [Primal](https://primal.net){:target="_blank"}: Polished web-client
    2. [Iris](https://iris.to){:target="_blank"}: Works in Browser and on Android
    3. [Snort](https://snort.social){:target="_blank"}: Browser-based

> Note: The feature set of different nostr clients can be different depending on what and how they are implemented. Basic messaging should be available on all clients but e.g. Lightning zaps(small amounts of bitcoin sent to another user) or group chat features are not included on all clients. [More info](https://www.nostr.net/) on feature set of nostr clients

> **Posting**: Beware that there is no central authority on nostr to remove content from all relays. Therefore, **there is no 100% surefire way to delete content from nostr relays!**

> **Data backups**: You are using multiple relays to store your data redundantly but there is no guarantee that this data will be preserved by relays forever. You should connect to at least one trustworthy relay that stores your data. Furthermore you may create data backups every now and then or even run your own relay for automatic backup purpose

> **Moderation of discussion: Nostr pushes many functionalities to the client side. This also means that there is no real way for anyone to moderate any discussion single-handedly.** In consequence, there is no automatic curation of people and topics that you are interested in

> You can choose to use *your own* content-filtering methods though:
1. Some of this happens already based on what `relays` you are connected to(they don't store anything people send)
2. `Following/unfollowing` people and #hashtags
3. `Blocking` and/or `Reporting` people in most clients. Blocking should discard any messages sent to you from that person by the clients and reporting a person signals to your social network that you found someone abusive for some reason
4. `Joining or leaving` public `group` chats
5. There can be `automatic message filters` implemented in `clients`. They could be beneficial if they filter spam but this gives also way to discard things you would want to keep. Always check moderation policies of the clients you are using and opt out if you are uncomfortable with the app developer's choices. Or even better, fork their open-source projects and implement your own! ;)

## Tor
{: .no_toc }
The Tor browser is a powerful privacy tool to fend off snoopers trying to monitor our online activities and potentially do us harm. A bitcoin pleb cannot let this happen. Browsing anything bitcoin-related in clear-net comes with some privacy risks.

Tor is great for looking up simple info but can be a painfully slow experience and time is the scarcest of all things. Instead you can browse with Firefox or [Mullvad browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser){:target="_blank"} coupled with [Proton](https://protonvpn.com/){:target="_blank"}- or [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en){:target="_blank"} VPN service enabled on the desktop. VPN is great but choose wisely because many of the services out there are just a fraud and you trust them not to log your activities and they can start logging without notice anytime the government asks them to do so.

## OBJECTIVE: Download, verify and Install Tor browser(process similar to Mullvad browser)([Progress images](/progress-get-on-board/){:target="_blank"})
1. üí° Learn about [Verification of digital information](/pleb-lessons/#verifying-digital-information)
2. Your Ubuntu came with a handy tool to use for encryption and verification: GPG(Gnu Privacy Guard, implementing the OpenPGP standard). Open a terminal to use it
    1. Super + start typing ‚Äúterminal‚Äù(add to favorites with right-click)
3. Go to the [website](https://www.torproject.org/){:target="_blank"} of the Tor project. It should be a simple https website(check the little lock icon in the address bar)
4. Go to `Download Tor Browser` and select Linux
5. Download the signature file as well
7. In the terminal navigate into the download directory
	```sh
	cd ~/Downloads
	```
8. Verify Tor Browser (use `man <command>` where you are unsure)
    2. You download the public key(or get it by any other means) of the developer(s) and import it in gpg
    ```sh
	gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org
	```
    6. You verify the signature of the file against the public key
    ```sh
	gpg --verify tor-browser-linux64-12.0.5_ALL.tar.xz.asc
	```
    8. Note: Verification processes can vary for different software but the fundamentals remain the same
9. Install Tor browser with the command line method [according to instructions](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/){:target="_blank"}:
    8. Run the command to extract the archive
        ```sh
		tar -xf tor-browser‚Ä¶. <press Tab to complete>
		```
    9. Go inside the extracted directory
        ```sh
		cd tor-browser
		```
    10. Make the desktop file executable
        ```sh
		sudo chmod +x start-tor‚Ä¶.<press Tab>
		```
    11. Run Tor browser. First time run it with a command argument to register the desktop app
        ```sh
		./start-tor-browser<press Tab> --register-app
		```
	12. You can now launch Tor browser using the `Super + <typing>` method
	13. Add Tor browser to favorites

When you are doing anything bitcoin-related the most interaction is going to be with your bitcoin wallet software. This is the brain coordinating your efforts to manage and monitor your funds. One of the most popular wallets today is Sparrow wallet. It allows for ease of use while implementing advanced features. Learning bitcoin starts with Sparrow wallet in my opinion. So let‚Äôs start to use it!

---

## OBJECTIVE: Start using Sparrow wallet([Progress images](/progress-get-on-board/){:target="_blank"})
1. Open Firefox browser and navigate to the [Sparrow wallet website](https://sparrowwallet.com/){:target="_blank"}(clearnet link)
    1. Download is very slow on Tor browser but you can try
2. Go to Download and navigate to version 1.7.6 in [previous releases](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/tag/1.7.6){:target="_blank"}(known working version with the this course)
3. Download these files(click ‚Äúshow all assets‚Äù to expand the list)
	* sparrow_1.7.6.1_amd64.deb(debian 64-bit linux package, no server in name!) 
	* ‚Ä¶manifest.txt file
	* ‚Ä¶manifest.txt.**asc** file
4. Verify the downloaded software according to [instructions](https://sparrowwallet.com/download/){:target="_blank"}:
    5. Import Craig Raw‚Äôs(developer of Sparrow wallet) public key
        ```sh
		curl https://keybase.io/craigraw/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
		```
    6. The manifest file contains the [hash fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)){:target="_blank"} of the different releases. If you view the file you can see the release you downloaded is also listed. If we can trust the manifest file then we can generate a fingerprint from our downloaded Sparrow file and compare that fingerprint with the one listed in the manifest file. If the fingerprint we generated matches the one listed in the manifest file then we can trust the downloaded software and go ahead with the installation 
    7. To trust the manifest file you have to check its signature against Craig‚Äôs public key
    8. Go to Downloads
        ```sh
		cd ~/Downloads
		```
    9. Verify the manifest files signature:
        ```sh
		gpg ‚Äìverify sparrowsparrow-1.7.6-manifest.txt.asc
		```
    10. Now verify that the manifest file contains the exact fingerprint of our release. We ignore missing releases in the list that we did not download
        ```sh
		sha256sum -c sparrow-1.7.6-manifest.txt --ignore-missing
		```
    11. To sum up this kind of verification visually
5. Now we can somewhat trust this software so let‚Äôs install it
    12. The most used packages are installed using Ubuntu‚Äôs predefined package repositories but since Sparrow is custom Software let‚Äôs install the downloaded ‚Äú.deb‚Äù package manually
    13. In the directory where sparrow was downloaded run this command
        ```sh
		sudo apt install ./sparrow_1.7.6-1_amd64.deb
		```
6. Sparrow wallet is now installed but don‚Äôt launch it just yet!

Bitcoin plebs have a wonderful training ground to hone their skills in a safe environment. It is called bitcoin testnet. These are bitcoin networks that function almost the same as the ‚Äúmainnet‚Äù - i.e. real-money version, just they are for testing, learning and experimenting with fake-bitcoin. There are multiple testnets for different purposes. The one you will use is quite new and it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSignet‚Äù.

---

## OBJECTIVE: Configure Sparrow to launch in signet mode([Progress images](/progress-get-on-board/){:target="_blank"})
1. The easiest way to make Sparrow always launch in signet mode is to set a so-called ‚Äúenvironment variable‚Äù which is just a fancy term for ‚ÄúI want this program to run with these special parameters‚Äù
2. In the terminal edit this file that contains important things to run at startup
    ```sh
	nano ~/.profile
	```
3. At the bottom insert this line to force Sparrow to launch in signet mode every time
    ```sh
	export SPARROW_NETWORK=‚Äùsignet‚Äù
	```
4. Then insert another line allowing you to launch Sparrow from anywhere in the terminal not just where it is actually located `/opt/sparrow/bin`
    ```sh
	export PATH=‚Äù$PATH:/opt/sparrow/bin‚Äù
	```
5. Save the file: `ctrl + o` --> `enter`
6. Exit nano: `ctrl + x`
7. Restart your computer for it to take effect
    ```sh
	reboot
	```
8. Now you can launch Sparrow and add it to favorites
9. On first launch it gives you an initial mini-tutorial. At the end you can configure your server settings
10. This setting is also available from File menu
11. In the `Server settings` connect Sparrow to the bitcoin plebs signet server through tor
    5. Select `Private Electrum` as Server Type
    6. Edit the `URL` and `Port` field, respectively:
    ```sh
    nvsnjmymbis5o3jnzplzzula4tkdh5ygpzoideao5jg53wigqbqpvaid.onion
    ```
    ```sh
    50021
    ```
12. Press the `‚ÄúTest Connection‚Äù` button and follow the logs. You should arrive at a screen something like this
    8. Sparrow is now connecting to the Bitcoin Plebs signet server through tor
13. Click Close
14. In the bottom-right corner you have the `Server switch` turned on and color blue, and next to it you see a sign that you are connected through tor which greatly increases your privacy
15. Hover over the icons with your mouse to check additional info. In Sparrow you can hover over many things and it will give you great additional insights
16. If Sparrow loses connection for any reason and you cannot re-establish it with the bitcoinplebs node, you can try these alternative signet nodes:  
Port: 
  ```sh
    38333
  ```  
URL-s:  
  ```sh
	s7fcvn5rblem7tiquhhr7acjdhu7wsawcph7ck44uxyd6sismumemcyd.onion
	```
  ```sh
	6megrst422lxzsqvshkqkg6z2zhunywhyrhy3ltezaeyfspfyjdzr3qd.onion
	```
  ```sh
	jahtu4veqnvjldtbyxjiibdrltqiiighauai7hmvknwxhptsb4xat4qd.onion
	```
  ```sh
	f4kwoin7kk5a5kqpni7yqe25z66ckqu6bv37sqeluon24yne5rodzkqd.onion
	```
  ```sh
	nsgyo7begau4yecc46ljfecaykyzszcseapxmtu6adrfagfrrzrlngyd.onion
	```
